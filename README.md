Hi there! I'm a 22-year-old programmer who loves coding. I usually work with Next.js for business projects, but I also enjoy building bots with Python. Programming has been a passion of mine for some time, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges to take on and skills to develop.

At the moment, my portfolio page is down. If you'd like to get in touch, please send an email to hello@rscripts.net. Just make sure to include "Github" in the subject line so that I can easily identify your message.
